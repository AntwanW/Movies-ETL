# Movies-ETL
The goal of this project was to introduce the process of extracting, transforming, and loading movie data from various sources. From the data collected by Kaggle, Wikipedia, and Ratings, a movie database was built.

## Overview
This analysis aims to create a pipeline that reads new data and then performs transformations to clean, condense, and load it into existing tables.  To make the pipeline more efficient, we took the code that was previously created and re-implemented it.
